# Java Cloud Azure Day One

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to deploy a front end to an Azure Blob
- Understand how to deploy an API to an Azure App
- Understand how to spin up an Azure Postgres instance

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your machine
3. Install the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/)
4. Run the [Microsoft Azurite Storage Emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio%2Cblob-storage)

## Core Activity

For this exercise you should get a full stack web application working in Azure. You can create something simple and new or you may use an existing application, e.g. the cinema challenge and build a simple front end using technology you choose. You should build using the following approach:

- Back end API using Java and the Spring Boot Application starter package with at least 1 endpoint
- Front end using either `React` or `Angular` which makes at least one call to the API endpoint.  Your frontend repository should be pushed [here](https://github.com/boolean-uk/java-cloud-azure-day-1-frontend)
- Database using PostgresSQL hosted in Azure (you can start out using a Neon one and then convert it later)

## Extension Activity

- Any extended functionality you give your API will be awarded an Extension.

## Notes

We will be only using free tiers to create Azure items.
